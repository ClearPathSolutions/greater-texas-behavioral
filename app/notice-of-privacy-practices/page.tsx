/**
 * HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP).
 *
 * Added 2026-10-27 after LegitScript asked for a policy covering protected
 * health information, medical records and patient rights (Terms §V(e),
 * Certification Standard 10). /privacy-policy covers website data and already
 * pointed to an NPP "available on request" (its §6); this page makes it
 * available. Structure follows the HHS model notice:
 * https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/model-notices-privacy-practices/index.html
 *
 * Counsel should confirm: Privacy Officer designation, 42 CFR Part 2 program
 * status (see /privacy-policy header item 4), Texas Medical Records Privacy Act
 * specifics, and whether a mailing address is required for rights requests
 * (site.address is region-only — this is a virtual provider).

              <h2>Your rights</h2>
              <p>When it comes to your health information, you have certain rights.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Get a copy of your medical record.</strong> You can ask to
                  see or get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record and
                  other health information we have about you. We will provide a copy
                  or a summary, usually within 30 days of your request. We may charge
                  a reasonable, cost-based fee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ask us to correct your medical record.</strong> You can ask
                  us to correct health information about you that you think is
                  incorrect or incomplete. We may say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to your
                  request, but we will tell you why in writing within 60 days.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Request confidential communications.</strong> You can ask
                  us to contact you in a specific way (for example, home or office
                  phone) or to send mail to a different address. We will say
                  &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to all reasonable requests.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ask us to limit what we use or share.</strong> You can ask
                  us not to use or share certain health information for treatment,
                  payment, or our operations. We are not required to agree, and we
                  may say &ldquo;no&rdquo; if it would affect your care. If you pay
                  for a service or item out of pocket in full, you can ask us not to
                  share that information for the purpose of payment or our
                  operations with your health insurer. We will say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
                  unless a law requires us to share it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Get a list of those with whom we have shared information.</strong>{' '}
                  You can ask for an accounting of the times we have shared your
                  health information for six years prior to the date you ask, who we
                  shared it with, and why. We will include all disclosures except
                  those about treatment, payment, and health care operations, and
                  certain other disclosures (such as any you asked us to make). We
                  will provide one accounting a year for free but will charge a
                  reasonable, cost-based fee if you ask for another within 12 months.

                <li>
                  <strong>Get a copy of this privacy notice.</strong> You can ask for
                  a paper copy of this notice at any time, even if you have agreed to
                  receive it electronically.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Choose someone to act for you.</strong> If you have given
                  someone medical power of attorney or if someone is your legal
                  guardian, that person can exercise your rights and make choices
                  about your health information. We will confirm the person has this
                  authority before we take any action.

                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Your choices</h2>
              <p>
                For certain health information, you can tell us your choices about
                what we share. If you have a clear preference for how we share your
                information in the situations described below, talk to us. Tell us
                what you want us to do, and we will follow your instructions.
              </p>
              <p>In these cases, you have both the right and choice to tell us to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Share information with your family, close friends, or others
                  involved in your care.
                </li>
                <li>Share information in a disaster relief situation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you are not able to tell us your preference, for example if you
                are incapacitated, we may go ahead and share your information if we
                believe it is in your best interest. We may also share your
                information when needed to lessen a serious and imminent threat to
                health or safety.
              </p>
              <p>
                In these cases, we never share your information unless you give us
                written permission:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Marketing purposes.</li>
                <li>Sale of your information.</li>
                <li>Most sharing of psychotherapy notes.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We do not use your health information for fundraising. If that ever
                changes, we will tell you and you will be able to opt out.
              </p>

              <h2>Substance use disorder treatment records</h2>
              <p>
                Because we provide substance use disorder treatment, records that
                identify you as seeking or receiving such treatment are also
                protected by the federal confidentiality regulations at 42 C.F.R.
                Part 2. In general, we may not tell anyone outside our program that
                you attend the program, or disclose any information identifying you
                as having a substance use disorder, unless you consent in writing,
                the disclosure is allowed by a court order, or the disclosure is
                made to medical personnel in a medical emergency, to qualified
                personnel for research, audit, or program evaluation, or as
                otherwise permitted by Part 2. Violation of these federal
                regulations is a crime, and suspected violations may be reported to
                the appropriate authorities. Federal law and regulations do not
                protect any information about a crime committed by a patient at the
                program or against any person who works for the program, or about
                any threat to commit such a crime, and do not protect information
                about suspected child abuse or neglect from being reported under
                state law.
              </p>

              <h2>Our uses and disclosures</h2>
              <p>We typically use or share your health information in the following ways.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Treat you.</strong> We can use your health information and
                  share it with other professionals who are treating you.{' '}
                  <em>Example:</em> a physician treating you for a medical condition
                  asks our clinical team about your medications.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Run our organization.</strong> We can use and share your
                  health information to run our practice, improve your care, and
                  contact you when necessary. <em>Example:</em> we use health
                  information about you to manage your treatment and services.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Bill for your services.</strong> We can use and share your
                  health information to bill and get payment from health plans or
                  other entities. <em>Example:</em> we give information about you to
                  your health insurance plan so it will pay for your services.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We are also allowed or required to share your information in other
                ways, usually in ways that contribute to the public good, such as
                public health and research. We have to meet many conditions in the
                law before we can share your information for these purposes. Where
                42 C.F.R. Part 2 applies, we will only make these disclosures as that
                regulation permits.
              </p>
              <ul>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Comply with the law.</strong> We will share information
                  about you if state or federal laws require it, including with the
                  Department of Health and Human Services if it wants to see that we
                  are complying with federal privacy law.

                </li>
                <li>
                  We will let you know promptly if a breach occurs that may have

                <li>
                  We must follow the duties and privacy practices described in this

              <p>
                We deliver care through secure telehealth. Sessions are conducted
                over encrypted video and audio connections, and we do not record
                sessions without your written consent. You are responsible for
                choosing a private location for your sessions; we are not able to
                control who may overhear or see your screen on your end.

              <h2>State law</h2>
              <p>
                Texas law, including the Texas Medical Records Privacy Act, may give
                you additional protections for your medical information and may
                further restrict how we use or disclose information about mental
                health and substance use disorder treatment. Where state law is
                stricter than federal law, we follow the stricter requirement.
